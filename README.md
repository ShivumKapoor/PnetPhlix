# PnetPhlix

Movie recommendation application in C++ that has the ability to provide recommendations for up to 20K movies and for up to 100K users. 
Took inspiration from Netflix movie recommendation software by using matrix factorization to quickly process common genres, actors, 
and directors of movies for a specific user. 

Created as part of CS32 course at UCLA.
